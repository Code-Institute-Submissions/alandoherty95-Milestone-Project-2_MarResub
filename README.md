**Discover Limerick** is an interactive front-end development website promoting the magnificent city of Limerick in the south-west of Ireland. The website concentrates on three main areas - Attractions, Activities and Coffee. I have chosen to display 8 attractions, 8 activities and 8 coffee shops in and around Limerick City using Google Maps to help users identify and locate their desired destination.

  

The website has a home page showcasing selected attractions, activities and coffee shops. The home page will contain a full-width Google Map displaying the 24 selected locations which the website is promoting. It will also display current, up-to-date weather conditions for Limerick City, including the actual temperature and the feels like temperature. There are a total of 4 tabs excluding the home page. There are tabs for Attractions, Activities, Coffee and About. The About tab will display interesting facts and stories about Limerick City.

  

Every month, 1 attraction, 1 activity and 1 coffee shop will be featured as part of 'Our Monthly Favourites' initiative. These selections will be promoted and recommended more favourably than the others. The primary objective of the website is to encourage people of all ages to get outside more and become more active while exploring the many attractions that make Limerick such a renowned city. The website is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices.

  

50% of Limerick's population is under 35 years. The younger half of the population should be exercising for at least 30 minutes everyday. This platform gives users the ability to browse through the top attractions and activities that Limerick has to offer. The users can choose a desired location or multiple locations and use the integrated Google Maps API for navigation.

  

In preparation for this project, I conducted research online and surveyed my peers. From this research, I concluded that young people have become more health conscious in recent years and enjoy spending time outside away. Grabbing a takeaway coffee and going for a walk with friends is becoming increasingly popular. Discover Limerick makes it easy and convenient for people of all ages to get active while exploring the best attractions and activities this renowned city has to offer.

## User Experience (UX)

  
  

The website was designed to promote the best attractions, activities and coffee spots Limerick has to offer. This project was undertaken with a deep passion for Limerick City and is designed to be accessible on a range of devices. This allows users to access the website while on the move. It was created with three main objectives in mind:

  

- To encourage locals to explore and reconnect with their city

  

- To encourage people living outside of Limerick to visit the city

  

- To encourage people of all ages to be more active and spend more time outdoors

  

As mentioned, the website focuses on three main areas - Attractions, Activities and Coffee. <br>

  

**Attractions:** is a list of our top 8 selected sites or attractions. The flagship attraction promoted on the main homepage at the moment is King John's Castle. This site was selected as the first attraction as part of 'Our Monthly Favourites' initiative. It will be promoted more favourably than the other attractions for the month of February. King John's Castle is a 13th-century castle located on Kings Island in Limerick, next to the River Shannon. This is a family- friendly list with attractions for all ages. <br>

  

**Activities:** is a list of our top 8 selected activities or adventures. The centrepiece activity being on display is Cratloe Woods, a forested area with plenty of hiking and biking trails to explore. This list includes activities for all ages but also attracts the more adventurous kind. This place was selected as the first activity as part of 'Our Monthly Favourites' initiative. It will be promoted more favourably than the other attractions for the month of February.<br>

  

**Coffee:** is a list of our top 8 selected coffee shops. The flagship coffee shop selected was Hook & Ladder Sarsfield Street as the first attraction as part of 'Our Monthly Favourites' initiative. It will be promoted more favourably than the other coffee shops for the month of February. Hook & Ladder have four cafés located in Limerick, with Sarsfield Street being their main headquarters. <br>

  

All destinations have been marked on Google Maps displayed on the home page allowing users to identify and locate their desired destinations on the map. The main goal of the project is to encourage people of all ages to spend more time outside and become more active while exploring Limerick city. The website is designed to be responsive to mobile devices which allows users to access while moving around.

  

The home page displays current, up-to-date weather conditions for Limerick City, including the actual temperature, feels like temperature, wind speed and humidity. This allows users to plan and coordinate more effectively around the unpredictable weather conditions experienced in Ireland. We have added the option for users to toggle between viewing the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.

  
  

### User Stories

  

### Users:

- As a local of Limerick City, I want to quickly identify places I'd like to visit so that I can spend more time exploring and less time deciding where to go.

- As a visitor to Limerick, I want to find information about the many destinations so that I can organise my time efficiently in order to visit multiple destinations on the same day.

- As a relatively inactive person, I want to use a website to learn more about the attractions in Limerick to encourage me to become more active by getting outdoors more often.

  

### Owner:

- As the owner of this website I would like to provide images, descriptions and external links for each location selected encouraging people to be more active.

- As the owner, I want users to be able to effortlessly browse through the many selections and to choose their favourites.

- As the owner, I want to promote certain destinations more favourably than others for the duration of a month. These selections will be updated every month to showcase new ones.

- As the owner, I want to display all selected locations on a single map to allow users to plan their trips more efficiently.

  

### Design

  

- #### Colour Scheme

  

The colour scheme chosen for this website is pretty simplistic. The three colours used throughout the site are White (#FFFFFF), Nobel (#A0A0A0) and LightSeaGreen(#20B2AA).

  
  

![Light Sea Green Font](https://github.com/alandoherty95/Milestone-Project-2/blob/master/assets/images/light-sea-green-font-colors.png?raw=true)

  

The use of White and Nobel gives the website a sleek, clean look. I chose the LightSeaGreen colour because it is representative of County Limerick and the jerseys worn by GAA inter-county players in the past. Another reason I chose LightSeaGreen is because it is symbolic of the many key waterways that the city of Limerick was built on.

  

- #### Typography

  

The primary font used for the text on this website is Source® Sans Pro. Source® Sans Pro was Adobe's first open source typeface family and was designed by Paul D. Hunt. It is a sans serif typeface intended to work well in user interfaces. I chose this font because it is easy to read.

  

The headings on this website use the Big Shoulders font type. Big Shoulders is a superfamily of condensed American Gothic typefaces, created for the Chicago Design System, as well as the citizens of Chicago. The family's tall, sans-serif forms are based in Chicago's multiple histories in railway transport, public political action, and dance. It is a great font for headings because it is attractive to the eye.

  

![Discover Limerick Logo](https://github.com/alandoherty95/Milestone-Project-2/blob/master/assets/images/discover-limerick-logo.png?raw=true)

  

Another font used is Quicksand. Quicksand is a display sans serif with rounded terminals. It is designed for display purposes but kept legible enough to use in small sizes as well.

  

- #### Imagery

  

Imagery is vital for grabbing the attention and interest of the user. The large, background cover image was chosen to catch the user's attention. It also symbolises the dramatic local history of this renowned city. I found Pixabay and Pexels to be a great resource for images. I was able to find stunning, high-resolution images for use on this project. I also used photos from Google Images and local websites.

## Scope

  

People living in Limerick and other people visiting for a short trip have so many attractions and activities to choose from. There are a multitude of things to see and do in and around Limerick City. For this reason, we have selected the top locations to explore while visiting the city. This website narrows down the scope of locations into three tidy lists of attractions, activities and coffee shops.

  

Limerick is a compact city which has many sites to see and things to do, mostly within walking distance of one another. The demographic we are targeting is not limited to just adventurers but also families with kids of all ages. The website is intuitive and user-friendly presenting information about the best Limerick City has to offer.

  

The home page will display current, up-to-date weather conditions for Limerick City, including the actual temperature and the feels like temperature. This will allow users to organise and coordinate their plans more effectively to make the most of the ever-changing, unpredictable weather conditions.

  

Every month, 1 attraction, 1 activity and 1 coffee shop will be featured as part of 'Our Monthly Favourites' initiative. These selections will be promoted and recommended more favourably than the others. The selections will be updated from one month to the next to allow other less popular sites to be highlighted and promoted.

  

Each of the three tabs (Attractions, Activities & Coffee) display recommended places that the user may like. It will display three places at a time before shuffling and refreshing the selections every 15 seconds.

  

The final tab is entitled About. This includes interesting bits of information and stories about the history of Limerick.

- **Hotels & Restaurants** <br>

  

In the longer-term, we are hoping to implement a feature to include hotels & restaurants. This will allow users to plan their entire trips on the website without having to look externally.

- The website underwent testing routinely throughout the build. I found [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) to be extremely useful in the creation of this project. Chrome DevTools is a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser. DevTools was useful for editing on-the-fly and for diagnosing problems quickly.

  

- I found the Responsive Viewer Chrome Extension to be very useful in testing multiple screen sizes simultaneously. Responsive Viewer was used to test the responsiveness of the website on devices of small, medium and large size.

- I validated all HTML pages using the [Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input). The Markup Validator is a free service by W3C that helps check the validity of Web documents.

  

- I validated all CSS pages using the [Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input). The W3C CSS Validation Service is a free software created by the W3C to help Web designers and Web developers check Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

  

- I used [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) to ensure the JavaScript code complies with coding rules and to ensure there are no syntax errors. Minor syntax errors were detected and resolved during development.

  

- I reviewed all the selected locations in my Google Maps API individually to ensure all the ID's and markers were all working smoothly and were displaying in the correct locations on the map.

  

- I tested the Current Weather API feature to ensure it was functioning as intended. In early stages, the temperature was displaying 0 instead of the correct figure. I rewrote the code and tested multiple times. I found a solution by adjusting the following line of code:

  

` var temp = data.main.temp; ` in place of `var temp = Math.round(data.main.temp); `

  

This resolved my issue and allowed me to use a toggle for users to switch the temperature seamlessly between Celsius and Fahrenheit depending on the users' preference.

- One major bug I experienced was with GitHub. An issue affecting a number of developers, when trying to run a preview server ports were stuck on detecting and would not open a port. When I run command python3 -m http.server the terminal displays:

  

`33060 – detecting...`

  

`3306 – detecting...`

  

`8000 – detecting...`

  

- I experienced this issue for several hours on February 5th & 6th. I learned more about the issue from Slack and after a few hours, the ports were open again. The issue was logged by another developer experiencing the same issues: https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/3118.

  

- I found Lighthouse to be very helpful. Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. I was able to test the responsiveness and load times of the website using Lighthouse. I could also test the performance and accessibility on mobile and desktop (including private browsers).

  

- I faced some challenges in receiving feedback on my progress with the project due to social distancing measures in place. However, at different stages in the development of this website, I was able to gain valuable feedback from friends and family members. I used Microsoft Teams to video call friends and colleagues while sharing my screen. This allowed me to navigate throughout the website to show off some of the features. I received great feedback and was able to implement in a constructive way.

  

- I demonstrated the website to members of my family. This feedback session was very helpful in identifying areas to improve upon. The font size and images were increased after receiving feedback. This helped ensure the website was more user-friendly and intuitive to people of all ages.

  

- The recommended places were shuffling and refreshing too frequently. This was constructive feedback I received while demonstrating the website to family members. Consequently, I update the JS code to refresh the results every 30 seconds to resolve this.

**User Story 3:** As a relatively inactive person, I want to use a website to learn more about the attractions in Limerick to encourage me to become more active by getting outdoors more often.

I can navigate throughout the website to view all attractions, activities and coffee spots before deciding. Being able to see these attractions, motivates me to be more active and spend more time outdoors exploring. I like using the mobile version of the website because I can check it while moving around the city.

  

In order for this user to find a suitable destination:

- Open homepage of website.

- View navigation bar at the top of the page.

## Bugs

- I had an issue with the Accordion jumping to the top of the page every time I clicked on it. I was able to resolve this by adding this detail to each < a > tag.

  

`<a href="javascript:void(0);"></a>`

  

- The images did not display when I deployed the website at first. I quickly realised the images didn't use an absolute file path. I corrected this by adding absolute file paths instead of relative file paths.

  

- I experienced an issue with the Open Weather API feature. I identified a bug while testing the Current Weather to ensure it was functioning correctly. In the early stages, the current temperature was displaying 0 instead of the correct figure. I rewrote the code and tested multiple times. I found a solution by adjusted the following line of code:

  

` var temp = data.main.temp; ` in place of `var temp = Math.round(data.main.temp); `

  

This resolved my issue and allowed me to use a toggle for users to switch seamlessly between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

- I identified another bug in 'Our Monthly Favourites' section. I created a clickable card for each of our 3 'Monthly Favourites'. After rewriting code and testing, I found that the issue was simply a missing full stop in my JS code.

  

`var cards = document.querySelectorAll("favourite-card");` was adjusted to `var cards = document.querySelectorAll(".favourite-card");`

  

I made this adjustment and tested again. The clickable cards are now functioning and allows the user to navigate directly to either of the 3 'Monthly Favourites' by clicking anywhere on the card.

- I was having an issue with the info windows in Google Maps. Multiple info windows could stay open at the same time. This is a negative user experience. I identified the problem and reworked my JS code to resolve this bug. I was able to improve my Google Maps API code by adding extra markers to distinguish between attractions, activities and coffee spots.

  

I added the following code to my Google Maps API to close previous info window when a new marker was clicked on:

`function closeOtherInfo() {`

`if( InfoObj.length > 0) {`

`InfoObj[0].set("marker", null);`

`InfoObj[0].close();`

`InfoObj[0].length = 0;`

`}`

`}`
