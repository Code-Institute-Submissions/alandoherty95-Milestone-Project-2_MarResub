                <p>Cratloe Woods is a forested area around the village of Cratloe, just outside of Limerick city. Much of the original oak forest has been replaced with coniferous softwoods during the past century; however, small pockets of native oak survive. Cratloe Wood Car Park and Picnic Site is located adjacent to Cratloe village and on the western side Cratloe Forest property which is over 700 Hectares in extent. It overlooks the Estuary of the River Shannon which is the longest river in Ireland and Great Britain. The Galtee Mountains in Co. Tipperary can be seen to the east, the Ballyhoura Mountains in North Cork to the south and Shannon Airport to the west.

                </p>

                <p>There is an extensive road network throughout the wood suitable for walking, hiking or biking. It is believed that the beams of the roof in Westminster Hall originally came from Cratloe Wood. Cratloe Wood, in County Clare, gets its name from the Irish for land of the Sally trees. On the western side of the forest, there is a picnic site and playground suitable for young children. 

                </p>

                <p>In the ninth century this was a territory belonging to the MacNamara family and was invaded by the Men of Ulster. These men took from Cratloe the wood that built the roof of the royal palace of Aileach near Derry.</p>

                <p>The site is operated by Coillte, a State owned company that operates a number of forestry areas throughout Ireland.

                <p>Bunratty Castle is a 15th-century castle and living 19th-century village bringing the periods alive at this family-friendly museum. The castle and the adjoining folk park are run by Shannon Heritage as tourist attractions. It is widely recognised as the most complete and authentic castle in Ireland. The site on which Bunratty Castle stands was in origin a Viking trading camp in 970. The present structure is the last of four castles to be built on the site. The present structure was built by the MacNamara family around 1425. Circa 1500, Bunratty Castle came into the hands of the O'Brien clan, the most powerful clan in Munster and later Earls of Thomond.

                </p>

                <p>Bunratty Folk Park is set on 26 acres with our impressive park featuring over 30 buildings in a ‘living’ village and rural setting. Rural farmhouses, village shops and streets are recreated and furnished as they would have appeared at that time.</p>  

                <p>The village houses and shops in the Folk Park have been chosen from many different areas, to form a collection of typical 19th century urban Irish buildings – including the school, doctor’s house, pawnbrokers, pub, drapery, print works, grocery, hardware shop, pottery and a post office.

                The Hunt Museum

                <p>The Hunt Museum preserves and exhibits the original artefacts gathered, over a lifetime, by John and Gertrude Hunt and known as the Hunt Collection. The Museum also displays its own collections, as well as visiting exhibitions of Local, National and International significance with the overall aim of maximising their cultural and educational potential for the people of Limerick and Ireland. As antique dealers and advisors to collectors they built a thriving business and also began to acquire pieces that reflected their own interests and curiosity rather than for commercial purposes.

                </p>

                <p>During the latter stages of John’s life, they became increasingly aware of the scale of their collection and wished for it to remain intact.  Fortunately, The National Institute of Higher Education, later to become the University of Limerick, agreed to house part of the collection on a temporary basis. The Hunt Museum opened there, in 1978, in an exhibition room with the display designed by architect Arthur Gibney.
                </p>

                <p>During this period the Irish Government had declined the offer of the Collection, so finding a suitable home and owner to take responsibility for the artefacts became more urgent. The Hunt Museum Trust was established in 1974 to hold the Collection and the property at Craggaunowen, a 16th-century Irish tower house that the Hunts had restored, in trust on behalf of the people of Ireland.
